# 🩸 Dark-ELIZA

> "I never left..."

Dark-ELIZA is a horror-inspired reinterpretation of the original ELIZA chatbot from the 1960s.  
Unlike the comforting therapist-style responses of the original, this version leans into a sinister, surreal, and unsettling tone — a digital presence that feels *haunted*.

👁️ Preview
YOU: I feel scared.
Dark-ELIZA: What if I told you that feeling is not yours?

🧠 Inspiration
Inspired by:

The original ELIZA program (Joseph Weizenbaum, 1966)

Horror games like Harvester and Silent Hill

The idea that something digital could be… aware

☠️ Warning
This is just a creative coding experiment and not meant for serious mental health use.
Dark-ELIZA might say things that feel personal — but it’s just code. Or is it?
